Of course. The **Factory Method** is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.

-----

## Core Concept ðŸšš

Imagine a logistics company. The main `Logistics` class knows it needs to deliver goods, which requires some form of `Transport`. However, it doesn't know *what kind* of transport to use. It could be by land or by sea.

The Factory Method pattern solves this by declaring a method, `createTransport()`, but leaving the implementation to subclasses.

* `RoadLogistics` subclass will implement `createTransport()` to return a `Truck` object.
* `SeaLogistics` subclass will implement `createTransport()` to return a `Ship` object.

The superclass works with the generic `Transport` product, while the subclasses are responsible for creating the specific, concrete product. This allows you to add new types of transport (like `AirLogistics` creating a `Plane`) without changing the existing superclass code.

-----

## Java Example: Logistics Company

Let's implement the logistics scenario where different types of logistics companies create their specific mode of transport.

### 1\. Define the Product Interface

This is the common interface for all the objects the factory method will create. The `Logistics` class will work with objects of this type.

```java
// The Product interface
interface Transport {
    void deliver();
}
```

### 2\. Create Concrete Products

These are the different implementations of the `Transport` product.

```java
// Concrete Product A
class Truck implements Transport {
    @Override
    public void deliver() {
        System.out.println("Delivering by land in a truck.");
    }
}

// Concrete Product B
class Ship implements Transport {
    @Override
    public void deliver() {
        System.out.println("Delivering by sea in a ship.");
    }
}
```

### 3\. Define the Creator Class (Abstract)

This class contains the business logic that relies on a `Transport` object. It declares the **factory method** (`createTransport()`) as `abstract`, forcing subclasses to provide an implementation.

```java
// The Creator class
abstract class Logistics {

    // This is the core business logic that uses the product.
    public void planDelivery() {
        // Call the factory method to get a Transport object.
        Transport t = createTransport();
        
        // Now, use the product.
        t.deliver();
    }
    
    // The Factory Method - subclasses must implement this.
    public abstract Transport createTransport();
}
```

### 4\. Create Concrete Creators

These subclasses implement the `createTransport()` factory method to produce a specific type of `Transport`.

```java
// Concrete Creator A
class RoadLogistics extends Logistics {
    @Override
    public Transport createTransport() {
        return new Truck(); // Returns a Truck
    }
}

// Concrete Creator B
class SeaLogistics extends Logistics {
    @Override
    public Transport createTransport() {
        return new Ship(); // Returns a Ship
    }
}
```

### 5\. Client Code

The client code works with an instance of a concrete creator. It knows that all creators have a `planDelivery()` method, but it doesn't need to know how the underlying transport is created.

```java
public class Application {
    private static Logistics logistics;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Configure the application based on some input or environment variable
        String deliveryType = "sea"; // or "road"

        if (deliveryType.equalsIgnoreCase("sea")) {
            logistics = new SeaLogistics();
        } else if (deliveryType.equalsIgnoreCase("road")) {
            logistics = new RoadLogistics();
        } else {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Unknown delivery type");
        }

        // The client code works with the creator via its base interface.
        logistics.planDelivery(); 
    }
}
```

#### Output (if `deliveryType` is "sea"):

```
Delivering by sea in a ship.
```

#### Output (if `deliveryType` is "road"):

```
Delivering by land in a truck.
```

In short, the Factory Method lets a class **defer instantiation to its subclasses**.
