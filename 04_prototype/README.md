Of course\! The **Prototype** pattern is all about creating new objects by copying an existing object, known as the "prototype." Instead of creating an object from scratch using the `new` keyword, you clone a pre-existing instance. This is particularly useful when the cost of creating a new object is more expensive than cloning it.

Think of it like cell division (mitosis) ðŸ§¬. A cell doesn't build a new cell from basic molecules every time; it splits itself to create a near-identical copy. The original cell is the prototype.

-----

## How It Works

The pattern has a few key parts:

* **Prototype Interface/Class**: This declares a `clone()` method. It's often an abstract class that provides some basic functionality and forces subclasses to implement the cloning logic.
* **Concrete Prototype**: This is a specific class that implements the `clone()` method. The cloning process involves creating a new object of the same class and copying the values of the original object's fields.
* **Client**: The client creates a new object by asking a prototype to clone itself. Often, a "registry" or "cache" is used to store pre-built, ready-to-clone prototypes.

## Java Example

Hereâ€™s a simple Java example using shapes. We'll have an abstract `Shape` class and concrete `Circle` and `Rectangle` classes. We'll also create a `ShapeCache` to store and retrieve our prototypes.

### 1\. The Prototype: `Shape.java`

First, we define our abstract prototype class. It implements `Cloneable` and defines an abstract `clone()` method.

```java
// The abstract prototype class
public abstract class Shape implements Cloneable {
    private String id;
    protected String type;

    abstract void draw();

    public String getType(){
        return type;
    }

    public String getId() {
        return id;
    }

    public void setId(String id) {
        this.id = id;
    }

    // The key clone() method
    @Override
    public Object clone() {
        Object clone = null;
        try {
            clone = super.clone();
        } catch (CloneNotSupportedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        return clone;
    }
}
```

### 2\. Concrete Prototypes: `Rectangle.java` & `Circle.java`

These classes extend `Shape` and provide their specific implementations.

```java
// Concrete prototype: Rectangle
public class Rectangle extends Shape {
    public Rectangle(){
        type = "Rectangle";
    }

    @Override
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Inside Rectangle::draw() method.");
    }
}

// Concrete prototype: Circle
public class Circle extends Shape {
    public Circle(){
        type = "Circle";
    }

    @Override
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Inside Circle::draw() method.");
    }
}
```

### 3\. The Prototype Registry: `ShapeCache.java`

This class acts as our registry. It creates a few initial shape objects (our prototypes), stores them in a `Hashtable`, and provides a method to fetch a clone of a stored shape.

```java
import java.util.Hashtable;

// The registry that stores and returns cloned prototypes
public class ShapeCache {
    private static Hashtable<String, Shape> shapeMap = new Hashtable<>();

    public static Shape getShape(String shapeId) {
        Shape cachedShape = shapeMap.get(shapeId);
        // The clone() call is the core of the pattern
        return (Shape) cachedShape.clone();
    }

    // For each shape run database query and create shape
    // loadInitialCache() just mimics that
    public static void loadInitialCache() {
        Circle circle = new Circle();
        circle.setId("1");
        shapeMap.put(circle.getId(), circle);

        Rectangle rectangle = new Rectangle();
        rectangle.setId("2");
        shapeMap.put(rectangle.getId(), rectangle);
    }
}
```

### 4\. Client Code: `PrototypeDemo.java`

Finally, let's see how the client uses the `ShapeCache` to get new objects without knowing their concrete classes.

```java
public class PrototypeDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Load the initial prototypes into the cache
        ShapeCache.loadInitialCache();

        // Get clones from the cache
        Shape clonedShape1 = ShapeCache.getShape("1");
        System.out.println("Shape : " + clonedShape1.getType());

        Shape clonedShape2 = ShapeCache.getShape("2");
        System.out.println("Shape : " + clonedShape2.getType());
    }
}
```

#### Output:

```
Shape : Circle
Shape : Rectangle
```

As you can see, we created new `Circle` and `Rectangle` objects simply by cloning the pre-existing prototypes from the cache. We never used `new Circle()` or `new Rectangle()` in our client code.

## When to Use the Prototype Pattern ðŸ¤”

* When creating an object is **resource-intensive** (e.g., requires a database call or complex computation). Cloning a ready-made instance is faster.
* When you want to **hide the complexity** of creating objects from the client. The client just asks for a clone without needing to know the specific subclass.
* When you have a system with many object types that are slight variations of each other. You can create a few prototypes and then clone and modify them as needed.
