Of course\! Here's a gist of the Template Method design pattern with a Java example.

The **Template Method** is a behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a superclass but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure. üßê

In simpler terms, you create a template for a process. The overall process flow is fixed, but some specific parts can be customized by other classes that use the template. Think of it like a fill-in-the-blanks document.

### Core Idea

The pattern consists of two main parts:

1.  **Abstract Class:** This class contains a `templateMethod()` which is marked as `final` (so it cannot be overridden). This method defines the algorithm's skeleton by calling a series of other methods. Some of these methods are abstract (must be implemented by subclasses), while others might have a default implementation.
2.  **Concrete Class(es):** These classes extend the Abstract Class and provide concrete implementations for the abstract steps defined in the parent.

This allows you to enforce a specific algorithm structure while giving subclasses the flexibility to define the details of certain steps.

### Java Example: Building a House üè†

Let's imagine a process for building a house. The general steps are always the same: build the foundation, build pillars, build walls, and build windows. The `templateMethod` will be `buildHouse()`. However, the materials used for the walls and pillars might differ (e.g., wood vs. glass).

#### 1\. The Abstract Class (The Blueprint)

Here, we define the overall `buildHouse()` algorithm. The specific methods for building pillars and walls are left `abstract` for subclasses to implement.

```java
// Abstract class defining the template method
public abstract class HouseTemplate {

    // This is the template method. It's final to prevent subclasses from changing the algorithm.
    public final void buildHouse() {
        buildFoundation();
        buildPillars(); // Step to be implemented by subclasses
        buildWalls();   // Step to be implemented by subclasses
        buildWindows();
        System.out.println("House is built!");
    }

    // Abstract methods to be implemented by subclasses
    protected abstract void buildPillars();
    protected abstract void buildWalls();

    // Default implementation (common for all houses)
    private void buildFoundation() {
        System.out.println("Building foundation with cement, iron rods, and sand.");
    }

    private void buildWindows() {
        System.out.println("Building glass windows.");
    }
}
```

#### 2\. Concrete Classes (Specific House Types)

Now, we create specific types of houses that provide their own implementations for building pillars and walls.

**Wooden House:**

```java
public class WoodenHouse extends HouseTemplate {

    @Override
    protected void buildPillars() {
        System.out.println("Building pillars with wood coating.");
    }

    @Override
    protected void buildWalls() {
        System.out.println("Building wooden walls.");
    }
}
```

**Glass House:**

```java
public class GlassHouse extends HouseTemplate {

    @Override
    protected void buildPillars() {
        System.out.println("Building pillars with glass coating.");
    }

    @Override
    protected void buildWalls() {
        System.out.println("Building glass walls.");
    }
}
```

#### 3\. Running the Code

Finally, let's see how the client code uses these classes. Notice that the client only calls the `buildHouse()` method, and the correct sequence of steps is executed based on the object's type.

```java
public class BuilderDemo {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("--- Building a Wooden House ---");
        HouseTemplate woodenHouse = new WoodenHouse();
        woodenHouse.buildHouse(); // Calls the template method

        System.out.println("\n--- Building a Glass House ---");
        HouseTemplate glassHouse = new GlassHouse();
        glassHouse.buildHouse(); // Calls the same template method
    }
}
```

#### Output:

```
--- Building a Wooden House ---
Building foundation with cement, iron rods, and sand.
Building pillars with wood coating.
Building wooden walls.
Building glass windows.
House is built!

--- Building a Glass House ---
Building foundation with cement, iron rods, and sand.
Building pillars with glass coating.
Building glass walls.
Building glass windows.
House is built!
```

As you can see, the `buildHouse()` algorithm's structure remains the same, but the steps for `buildPillars()` and `buildWalls()` were successfully customized by the `WoodenHouse` and `GlassHouse` subclasses.
