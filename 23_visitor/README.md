Of course\! Here's a gist of the Visitor design pattern with a Java example.

The **Visitor** pattern is a way to separate an algorithm from the object structure on which it operates. Essentially, it lets you add new operations to a group of classes without modifying the classes themselves. This is particularly useful when you have a stable set of classes but need to perform various, and sometimes unrelated, operations on them.

Think of it like a mechanic visiting different parts of a car üöó. The car parts (engine, wheels, transmission) don't need to know how the mechanic will service them. The mechanic (`Visitor`) brings the expertise and performs the specific operation (`visit`) on each part (`Element`). If you need a different service, like a paint job, you just send a different specialist (another `Visitor`).

### Key Components

1.  **Visitor Interface**: Declares a `visit()` method for each type of "element" it can operate on.
2.  **Concrete Visitor**: Implements the `Visitor` interface and contains the actual algorithm for each element type.
3.  **Element Interface**: Declares an `accept()` method that takes a `Visitor` as an argument.
4.  **Concrete Element**: Implements the `Element` interface. Its `accept()` method calls the `Visitor`'s `visit()` method, passing itself as an argument.

This process is called **double dispatch**: the operation that gets executed depends on both the type of the `Visitor` and the type of the `Element`.

### Java Example: Calculating Shipping Costs

Imagine you have a shopping cart with different types of items (elements), like books and electronics. You want to calculate the total shipping cost, but the calculation logic is different for each item type.

#### 1\. Define the Element and Visitor Interfaces

First, we define the contract for our items (`Visitable`) and our shipping calculator (`Visitor`).

`ItemElement.java` (Visitable)

```java
// The Element interface
public interface ItemElement {
    double accept(ShoppingCartVisitor visitor);
}
```

`ShoppingCartVisitor.java` (Visitor)

```java
// The Visitor interface with a visit() method for each element type
public interface ShoppingCartVisitor {
    double visit(Book book);
    double visit(Electronic electronic);
}
```

#### 2\. Create Concrete Element Classes

These are the specific items in our cart. Each one implements the `accept()` method, which simply calls the correct `visit()` method on the visitor.

`Book.java` (Concrete Element)

```java
public class Book implements ItemElement {
    private double price;
    private double weight;

    public Book(double price, double weight) {
        this.price = price;
        this.weight = weight;
    }

    public double getPrice() {
        return price;
    }

    public double getWeight() {
        return weight;
    }

    @Override
    public double accept(ShoppingCartVisitor visitor) {
        return visitor.visit(this);
    }
}
```

`Electronic.java` (Concrete Element)

```java
public class Electronic implements ItemElement {
    private double price;
    private double weight;
    private boolean isFragile;

    public Electronic(double price, double weight, boolean isFragile) {
        this.price = price;
        this.weight = weight;
        this.isFragile = isFragile;
    }

    public double getPrice() {
        return price;
    }

    public double getWeight() {
        return weight;
    }

    public boolean isFragile() {
        return isFragile;
    }

    @Override
    public double accept(ShoppingCartVisitor visitor) {
        return visitor.visit(this);
    }
}
```

#### 3\. Create a Concrete Visitor

This class contains the actual shipping cost logic. Shipping for books is based on weight, while electronics have an extra fee if they are fragile.

`ShippingCostVisitor.java` (Concrete Visitor)

```java
public class ShippingCostVisitor implements ShoppingCartVisitor {
    @Override
    public double visit(Book book) {
        // Shipping cost for books is $2 per kg
        double cost = book.getWeight() * 2;
        System.out.println("Book shipping cost: $" + cost);
        return cost;
    }

    @Override
    public double visit(Electronic electronic) {
        // Shipping cost for electronics is $5 per kg
        double cost = electronic.getWeight() * 5;
        // Add an extra $10 if it's fragile
        if (electronic.isFragile()) {
            cost += 10;
        }
        System.out.println("Electronic shipping cost: $" + cost);
        return cost;
    }
}
```

#### 4\. Client Code

Finally, let's put it all together. We create a list of items and use our `ShippingCostVisitor` to calculate the total cost.

`VisitorDemo.java` (Client)

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class VisitorDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<ItemElement> items = new ArrayList<>();
        items.add(new Book(20, 2)); // price $20, weight 2kg
        items.add(new Electronic(200, 3, true)); // price $200, weight 3kg, fragile
        items.add(new Electronic(150, 5, false)); // price $150, weight 5kg, not fragile

        calculateTotal(items);
    }

    private static void calculateTotal(List<ItemElement> items) {
        ShoppingCartVisitor visitor = new ShippingCostVisitor();
        double totalCost = 0;
        for (ItemElement item : items) {
            totalCost += item.accept(visitor);
        }
        System.out.println("-------------------------");
        System.out.println("Total Shipping Cost: $" + totalCost);
    }
}
```

**Output:**

```
Book shipping cost: $4.0
Electronic shipping cost: $25.0
Electronic shipping cost: $25.0
-------------------------
Total Shipping Cost: $54.0
```

If you later wanted to add a "calculate tax" operation, you would simply create a new `TaxVisitor` class without touching any of the existing `Book` or `Electronic` classes.

### When to Use It üëç

* When you have a complex object structure and you need to perform many different and unrelated operations on its elements.
* When the classes that make up the object structure are stable and rarely change.
* When you want to keep the operational logic separate from the element classes.

### Downsides üëé

* **Difficult to add new Element classes**. If you add a new `ConcreteElement` (e.g., a `Clothing` class), you must update the `Visitor` interface and all its implementations to add a new `visit(Clothing clothing)` method. This can be a major hassle.
